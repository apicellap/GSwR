# Getting Acqainted with R 

## Using R as a giant calculator 

Produce a sequence of numbers: 
```{r sequence}
seq(from = 0,
    to = 10, 
    by = 1) #interval 
```

## Your first script

Creating objects: 
```{r script-001}
x<-seq(from = 0, to = 10, by =0.5)
x
y<-seq(from = 101, to = 110, by =0.5)
```

Add the objects together to create a new object: 
```{r add-objects}
z <- x + y  
z
```

Print the session information: 
```{r session-info}
sessionInfo()
```
