# About {-}

This resource encompasses my compiled notes on, *Getting Started with R: An Introduction for Biologists* Second edition. These notes are not meant to replace the textbook. Instead they may act as a helpful guide.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
